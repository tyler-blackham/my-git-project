<h1>All about me</h1>

<p> My name is Tyler Blackham, and I am a student at Utah State University </p>
<p>The best part about making a mess is putting everything back the right way. I love organizing things and seeing them neat and orderly, be it data sheets, filing cabinets, or the inside of a computer with its perfectly placed parts.</p>
<p>I am currently studying Information Systems because, growing up, I loved keeping things organized and in working order. I would take apart remotes and computers just to lay all of the pieces out so I could analyze how every item fit perfectly in its place. Because of this, I loved taking apart broken technology to see if I could repair it. In High School, I helped keep the A/V equipment working and served as the Choir Librarian on our Choir Council, working as a team to make decisions for our choir program. As the Librarian, I was responsible for analyzing and improving our spreadsheet of over one thousand pieces of music in our library, entering changes as I went.</p>
<p>If you hire me, I will look for new and efficient ways to help you organize your data and work with you so that you're getting it the way you want. I'll keep your data updated, your computers working, and I won't stop working hard until the task is done. And then, it's on to the next project.1~If you hire me, I will look for new and efficient ways to help you organize your data and work with you so that you're getting it the way you want.
